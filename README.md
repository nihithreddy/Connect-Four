# Connect Four
A retro grid-based game in vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS

Connect Four (also known as Four Up, Plot Four, Find Four, Four in a Row, Four in a Line, Drop Four, and Gravitrips (in Soviet Union))
is a two-player board game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping one colored disc from the top into a
seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column.
The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs.
